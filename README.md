# Design Patterns in Action (GoF)

This repository contains implementations of all the **Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns** in Java. The GoF design patterns are a set of 23 foundational design patterns that provide solutions to common software design problems. These patterns are widely used in object-oriented design and help developers to create maintainable, scalable, and flexible software.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to **showcase my understanding of design patterns**. Each design pattern has been implemented in Java with code examples and explanations, allowing me to demonstrate how these patterns can be applied in real-world scenarios.

By working through these patterns, I aim to solidify my knowledge and share it with others who may be learning about software design patterns or looking for real-world examples.

## Scope

This repository includes the following design patterns:

- **Creational Patterns**: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor
